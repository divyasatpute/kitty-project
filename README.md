# 🐾 Kitty Project

Welcome to the **Kitty Project** — a modern, scalable, and cloud-native web application fully automated with industry-standard DevOps practices.

This project demonstrates how to **build, test, secure, and deploy** a production-grade application on **AWS EKS** using a complete CI/CD pipeline with **Jenkins**, **SonarQube**, **Docker**, **Terraform**, and **ArgoCD**.

## 📚 Project Structure

| Layer          | Technology                     | Purpose                        |
|----------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Infrastructure | Terraform                      | EKS Cluster, VPC, IAM Roles    |
| CI/CD          | Jenkins, SonarQube, Docker      | Build, Test, Quality Scan, Push|
| Deployment     | Kubernetes, ArgoCD              | GitOps-Based Automated Deployments |
| Monitoring     | (Planned) Prometheus, Grafana   | Observability (Optional future scope) |

## 🚀 Workflow Overview

1. **Infrastructure**:  
   - Provision AWS VPC, EKS Cluster, IAM, Networking using Terraform.

2. **Source Code Management**:
   - Host application code on GitHub.

3. **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
   - Jenkins Pipeline:
     - Checkout source code
     - Build Docker image
     - Perform static code analysis using SonarQube
     - Run unit tests
     - Push Docker image to DockerHub (or ECR)

4. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**:
   - Update Kubernetes manifests
   - Use ArgoCD to deploy to EKS automatically (GitOps)

5. **Post-Build**:
   - Clean up docker resources
   - Send build notifications (optional)
